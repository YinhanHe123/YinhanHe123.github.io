I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/electrical-and-computer-engineering) at [the University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), where I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Jundong Li](https://jundongli.github.io). Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. in mathematics and applied mathematics from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/).


<span style="color:red">**\[Open for Collaborations\]:**</span> I am happy to collaborate! Please feel free to [email me](mailto:nee7ne@virginia.edu).

**Research Summary:** My current research interest mainly lies in advancing interpretability of large language models. I have published four conference papers (two first author ones) and released four preprints in the following areas [[see full list]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SMHk6PMAAAAJ&hl=en):

* **Explainability:** Mechanistic Interpretability; Counterfactual Explanation;
* **Graph Machine Learning:** Efficient GNN; Safety in Graph Learning; 
* **Network Science**: Network Epidemiology; 
* **Causal Inference**: Causal Inference with Latent Variables;


<!-- I have abundant interest in **Graph Mining**, e.g., **Spectral Graph Theory**, **Graph Neural Networks** and corresponding interdisciplinary topics. -->
<!-- My previous research experiences mainly lie in graph mining and feature fusion. -->
